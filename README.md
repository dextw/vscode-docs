## Contributing to the documentation

To contribute with new topics/information or make changes to existing documentation, see [contributing](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing) for instructions and guidelines.

## Feedback

If you want to give documentation feedback, please use the feedback control located at the bottom of each documentation page.

## Documentation Issues

To enter documentation bugs, please create a [new GitHub issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/issues) (try to check if there isn't a topic about your issue already).

If you think the issue is with the VS Code product itself, please enter issues [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Editing

In order to edit the VS Code documentation, ensure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed.

Clone a copy of the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs.git
```

VS Code itself is great for reviewing and editing [Markdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown) with nice preview support.

If you want to use VS Code, simply navigate to the `vscode-docs` directory and launch VS Code from there:

```
cd vscode-docs
code .
```

You can open any of the Markdown files and see a preview with the **Open Preview to the Side** button in the upper right of the editor.
